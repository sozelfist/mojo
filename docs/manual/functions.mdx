description: Introduction to Mojo `fn` and `def` functions.
---

As mentioned in the [syntax overview](/mojo/manual/basics), Mojo supports two
types of functions: `def` and `fn` functions. You can use either declaration
with any function, including the `main()` function, but they have different
default behaviors, as described on this page.

We believe both `def` and `fn` have good use cases and don't consider either to
be better than the other. Deciding which to use is a matter of personal taste as
to which style best fits a given task.

We believe Mojo's flexibility in this regard is a superpower that allows you to
write code in the manner that's best for your project.

:::note

Functions declared inside a [`struct`](/mojo/manual/structs) are called
"methods," but they have all the same qualities as "functions" described here.

:::

## `fn` functions

The `fn` function has somewhat stricter rules than the `def` function.

Here's an example of an `fn` function:

```mojo
fn greet(name: String) -> String:
    var greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
    return greeting
```

As far as a function caller is concerned, `def` and `fn` functions are
interchangeable. That is, there's nothing a `def` can do that an `fn` can't
(and vice versa). The difference is that, compared to a `def` function, an `fn`
function is more strict on the inside.

Here's everything to know about `fn`:

* Arguments must specify a type (except for the
  `self` argument in [struct methods](/mojo/manual/structs#methods)).

* Return values must specify a type, unless the function doesn't return a value.

  If you don't specify a return type, it defaults to `None` (meaning no return
  value).

* By default, arguments are received as an immutable reference (values are
  read-only, using the `read` [argument
  convention](/mojo/manual/values/ownership#argument-conventions)).

  This prevents accidental mutations, and permits the use of non-copyable types
  as arguments.

  If you want a local copy, you can simply assign the value to a local
  variable. Or, you can get a mutable reference to the value by declaring the
  `mut` [argument
  convention](/mojo/manual/values/ownership#argument-conventions)).

* If the function raises an exception, it must be explicitly declared with the
  `raises` keyword. (A `def` function does not need to declare exceptions.)

By enforcing these type checks, using the `fn` function helps avoid a variety
of runtime errors.

## `def` functions

Compared to an `fn` function, a `def` function has fewer restrictions.
The `def` function works more like a Python
`def` function. For example, this function works the same in Python and Mojo:

```mojo
def greet(name):
    greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
    return greeting
```

In a Mojo `def` function, you have the option to specify the argument type and
the return type. You can also declare variables with `var`, with or without
explicit typing. So you can write a `def` function that looks almost exactly
like the `fn` function shown earlier:

```mojo
def greet(name: String) -> String:
    var greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
    return greeting
```

This way, the compiler ensures that `name` is a string, and the return type is a
string.

Here's everything to know about `def`:

* Arguments don't require a declared type.

  Undeclared arguments are actually passed as an
  [`object`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/object/object), which allows the
  function to receive any type (Mojo infers the type at runtime).

* Return types don't need to be declared, and also default to `object`. (If a
  `def` function doesn't declare a return type of `None`, it's considered to
  return an `object` by default.)

* Arguments are mutable. Arguments default to using the `read`
  [argument convention](/mojo/manual/values/ownership#argument-conventions)
  like an `fn` function, with a special addition: if the function mutates the
  argument, it makes a mutable copy.

  If an argument is an `object` type, it's received as a reference, following
  [object reference
  semantics](/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics#python-style-reference-semantics).

  If an argument is any other declared type, it's received as a value.

### The `object` type

If you don't declare the type for an argument or return value in a `def`, it
becomes an [`object`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/object/object), which is unlike
any other type in the standard library.

The `object` type allows for dynamic typing because it can actually represent
any type in the Mojo standard library, and the actual type is inferred at
runtime. (Actually, there's still more to do before it can represent all Mojo
types.) This is great for compatibility with Python and all of the flexibility
that it provides with dynamic types. However, this lack of type enforcement can
lead to runtime errors when a function receives or returns an unexpected type.

For compatibility with Python, `object` values are passed using [object
reference
semantics](/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics#python-style-reference-semantics).
As such, the `object` type is not compatible with the [argument
conventions](/mojo/manual/values/ownership#argument-conventions) that
enforce value semantics. So, be careful if using `object` values alongside other
strongly-typed values—their behavior might be inconsistent because `object` is
the only type in the standard library that does not conform to [full value
semantics](/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics#intro-to-value-semantics).

:::note TODO

The `object` type is still a work in progress. It doesn't support all of the
possible underlying types, for example.

:::

## Function arguments

As noted in the previous sections, there are a few differences between how `def`
and `fn` functions treat arguments. But most of the time they are the same.

As noted, there are some differences in *argument conventions*.
Argument conventions are discussed in much more detail in the page on
[Ownership](/mojo/manual/values/ownership#argument-conventions).

The other difference is that `def` functions don't need to specify an argument's
type. If no type is specified, the argument is passed as an
[`object`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/object/object).

The remaining rules for arguments described in this section apply to both `def`
and `fn` functions.

### Optional arguments

An optional argument is one that includes a default value, such as the `exp`
argument here:

```mojo
fn my_pow(base: Int, exp: Int = 2) -> Int:
    return base ** exp

fn use_defaults():
    # Uses the default value for `exp`
    var z = my_pow(3)
    print(z)
```

However, you cannot define a default value for an argument that's declared as
[`mut`](/mojo/manual/values/ownership#mutable-arguments-mut).

Any optional arguments must appear after any required arguments. [Keyword-only
arguments](#positional-only-and-keyword-only-arguments), discussed later, can
also be either required or optional.

### Keyword arguments

You can also use keyword arguments when calling a function. Keyword arguments
are specified using the format
<code><var>argument_name</var> = <var>argument_value</var></code>.
You can pass keyword arguments in any order:

```mojo
fn my_pow(base: Int, exp: Int = 2) -> Int:
    return base ** exp

fn use_keywords():
    # Uses keyword argument names (with order reversed)
    var z = my_pow(exp=3, base=2)
    print(z)
```

### Variadic arguments

Variadic arguments let a function accept a variable number of arguments. To
define a function that takes a variadic argument, use the variadic argument
syntax <code>*<var>argument_name</var></code>:

```mojo
fn sum(*values: Int) -> Int:
  var sum: Int = 0
  for value in values:
    sum = sum + value
  return sum
```

The variadic argument `values` here is a placeholder that accepts any number of
passed positional arguments.

You can define zero or more arguments before the variadic argument. When calling
the function, any remaining positional arguments are assigned to the variadic
argument, so any arguments declared **after** the variadic argument can only be
specified by keyword (see
[Positional-only and keyword-only arguments](#positional-only-and-keyword-only-arguments)).

Variadic arguments can be divided into two categories:

* Homogeneous variadic arguments, where all of the passed arguments are the same
  type—all `Int`, or all `String`, for example.
* Heterogeneous variadic arguments, which can accept a set of different argument
  types.

The following sections describe how to work with homogeneous and heterogeneous
variadic arguments.

:::note Variadic parameters

Mojo [parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters/) are distinct from arguments
(parameters are used for compile-time metaprogramming). Variadic parameters
are supported, but with some limitations—for details see
[variadic parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters/#variadic-parameters).

:::

#### Homogeneous variadic arguments

When defining a homogeneous variadic argument, use <code>*<var>argument_name</var>: <var>argument_type</var></code>:

```mojo
def greet(*names: String):
    ...
```

Inside the function body, the variadic argument is available as an iterable list
for ease of use. Currently there are some differences in handling the list
depending on whether the arguments are register-passable types (such as `Int`)
or memory-only types (such as `String`). TODO: We hope to remove these
differences in the future.

Register-passable types, such as `Int`, are available as a
[`VariadicList`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list/VariadicList) type. As
shown in the previous example, you can iterate over the values using a `for..in`
loop.

```mojo
fn sum(*values: Int) -> Int:
  var sum: Int = 0
  for value in values:
    sum = sum+value
  return sum
```

Memory-only types, such as `String`, are available as a
[`VariadicListMem`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list/VariadicListMem).
Iterating over this list directly with a `for..in` loop currently produces a
[`Reference`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/reference/Reference) for each value instead
of the value itself. You must add an empty subscript operator `[]` to
dereference the reference and retrieve the value:

```mojo
def make_worldly(mut *strs: String):
    # Requires extra [] to dereference the reference for now.
    for i in strs:
        i[] += " world"

```

Alternately, subscripting into a `VariadicListMem` returns the argument value,
and doesn't require any dereferencing:

```mojo
fn make_worldly(mut *strs: String):
    # This "just works" as you'd expect!
    for i in range(len(strs)):
        strs[i] += " world"
```

#### Heterogeneous variadic arguments

Implementing heterogeneous variadic arguments is somewhat more complicated than
homogeneous variadic arguments. Writing generic code to handle multiple argument
types requires [traits](/mojo/manual/traits) and
[parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters/). So the syntax may look a little
unfamiliar if you haven't worked with those features. The signature for a
function with a heterogeneous variadic argument looks like this:

```mojo
def count_many_things[*ArgTypes: Intable](*args: *ArgTypes):
    ...
```

The parameter list, `[*ArgTypes: Intable]` specifies that the function takes an
`ArgTypes` parameter, which is a list of types, all of which conform to the
[`Intable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/Intable) trait. The argument list,
`(*args: *ArgTypes)` has the familiar `*args` for the variadic argument, but
instead of a single type, its type is defined as *list* of types, `*ArgTypes`.

This means that each argument in `args` has a corresponding type in `ArgTypes`,
so <code>args[<var>n</var>]</code> is of type <code>ArgTypes[<var>n</var>]</code>.

Inside the function, `args` is available as a
[`VariadicPack`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list/VariadicPack). The easiest
way to work with the arguments is to use the `each()` method to iterate through
the `VariadicPack`:

```mojo
fn count_many_things[*ArgTypes: Intable](*args: *ArgTypes) -> Int:
    var total = 0

    @parameter
    fn add[Type: Intable](value: Type):
        total += int(value)

    args.each[add]()
    return total

print(count_many_things(5, 11.7, 12))
```

```output
28
```

In the example above, the `add()` function is called for each argument in turn,
with the appropriate `value` and `Type` values. For instance, `add()` is first
called with `value=5` and `Type=Int`, then with `value=11.7` and `Type=Float64`.

Also, note that when calling `count_many_things()`, you don't actually pass in
a list of argument types. You only need to pass in the arguments, and Mojo
generates the `ArgTypes` list itself.

As a small optimization, if your function is likely to be called with a single
argument frequently, you can define your function with a single argument
followed by a variadic argument. This lets the simple case bypass populating and
iterating through the `VariadicPack`.

For example, given a `print_string()` function that prints a single string, you
could re-implement the variadic `print()` function with code like this:

```mojo
fn print_string(s: String):
    print(s, end="")

fn print_many[T: Stringable, *Ts: Stringable](first: T, *rest: *Ts):
    print_string(str(first))

    @parameter
    fn print_elt[T: Stringable](a: T):
        print_string(" ")
        print_string(str(a))
    rest.each[print_elt]()
print_many("Bob")
```

```output
Bob
```

If you call `print_many()` with a single argument, it calls `print_string()`
directly. The `VariadicPack` is empty, so `each()` returns immediately without
calling the `print_elt()` function.

#### Variadic keyword arguments

Mojo functions also support variadic keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). Variadic
keyword arguments allow the user to pass an arbitrary number of keyword
arguments. To define a function that takes a variadic keyword argument, use the
variadic keyword argument syntax <code>**<var>kw_argument_name</var></code>:

```mojo
fn print_nicely(**kwargs: Int) raises:
  for key in kwargs.keys():
      print(key[], "=", kwargs[key[]])

 # prints:
 # `a = 7`
 # `y = 8`
print_nicely(a=7, y=8)
```

In this example, the argument name `kwargs` is a placeholder that accepts any
number of keyword arguments. Inside the body of the function, you can access
the arguments as a dictionary of keywords and argument values (specifically,
an instance of
[`OwnedKwargsDict`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/dict/OwnedKwargsDict)).

There are currently a few limitations:

* Variadic keyword arguments are always implicitly treated as if they
  were declared with the `owned` [argument
  convention](/mojo/manual/values/ownership#argument-conventions), and
  can't be declared otherwise:

  ```mojo
  # Not supported yet.
  fn read_var_kwargs(read **kwargs: Int): ...
  ```

* All the variadic keyword arguments must have the same type, and this
  determines the type of the argument dictionary. For example, if the argument
  is `**kwargs: Float64` then the argument dictionary will be a
  `OwnedKwargsDict[Float64]`.

* The argument type must conform to the
  [`CollectionElement`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/CollectionElement) trait.
  That is, the type must be both [`Movable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/Movable)
  and [`Copyable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/Copyable).

* Dictionary unpacking is not supported yet:

  ```mojo
  fn takes_dict(d: Dict[String, Int]):
    print_nicely(**d)  # Not supported yet.
  ```

* Variadic keyword *parameters* are not supported yet:

  ```mojo
  # Not supported yet.
  fn var_kwparams[**kwparams: Int](): ...
  ```

### Positional-only and keyword-only arguments

When defining a function, you can restrict some arguments so that they can only
be passed as positional arguments, or they can only be passed as keyword
arguments.

To define positional-only arguments, add a slash character (`/`) to the
argument list. Any arguments before the `/` are positional-only: they can't be
passed as keyword arguments. For example:

```mojo
fn min(a: Int, b: Int, /) -> Int:
    return a if a < b else b
```

This `min()` function can be called with `min(1, 2)` but can't be called using
keywords, like `min(a=1, b=2)`.

There are several reasons you might want to write a function with
positional-only arguments:

* The argument names aren't meaningful for the the caller.
* You want the freedom to change the argument names later on without breaking
  backward compatibility.

For example, in the `min()` function, the argument names don't add any real
information, and there's no reason to specify arguments by keyword.

For more information on positional-only arguments, see [PEP 570 – Python
Positional-Only Parameters](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570/).

Keyword-only arguments are the inverse of positional-only arguments: they can
only be specified by keyword. If a function accepts variadic arguments, any
arguments defined *after* the variadic arguments are treated as keyword-only.
For example:

```mojo
fn sort(*values: Float64, ascending: Bool = True): ...
```

In this example, the user can pass any number of `Float64` values, optionally
followed by the keyword `ascending` argument:

```mojo
var a = sort(1.1, 6.5, 4.3, ascending=False)
```

If the function doesn't accept variadic arguments, you can add a single star
(`*`) to the argument list to separate the keyword-only arguments:

```mojo
fn kw_only_args(a1: Int, a2: Int, *, double: Bool) -> Int:
    var product = a1 * a2
    if double:
        return product * 2
    else:
        return product
```

Keyword-only arguments often have default values, but this is not required. If a
keyword-only argument doesn't have a default value, it is a *required
keyword-only argument*. It must be specified, and it must be specified by
keyword.

Any required keyword-only arguments must appear in the signature before
any optional keyword-only arguments. That is, arguments appear in the following
sequence a function signature:

* Required positional arguments.
* Optional positional arguments.
* Variadic arguments.
* Required keyword-only arguments.
* Optional keyword-only arguments.
* Variadic keyword arguments.

For more information on keyword-only arguments, see [PEP 3102 – Keyword-Only
Arguments](https://peps.python.org/pep-3102/).

## Overloaded functions

If a `def` function does not specify argument types, then it can accept any
data type and decide how to handle each type internally. This is nice when you
want expressive APIs that just work by accepting arbitrary inputs, so there's
usually no need to write function overloads for a `def` function.

On the other hand, all `fn` functions must specify argument types, so if you
want a function to work with different data types, you need to implement
separate versions of the function that each specify different argument types.
This is called "overloading" a function.

For example, here's an overloaded `add()` function that can accept either
`Int` or `String` types:

```mojo
fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:
    return x + y

fn add(x: String, y: String) -> String:
    return x + y
```

If you pass anything other than `Int` or `String` to the `add()` function,
you'll get a compiler error. That is, unless `Int` or `String` can implicitly
cast the type into their own type. For example, `String` includes an overloaded
version of its constructor (`__init__()`) that accepts a `StringLiteral` value.
Thus, you can also pass a `StringLiteral` to a function that expects a `String`.

When resolving an overloaded function call, the Mojo compiler tries each
candidate function and uses the one that works (if only one version works), or
it picks the closest match (if it can determine a close match), or it reports
that the call is ambiguous (if it can't figure out which one to pick).

If the compiler can't figure out which function to use, you can resolve the
ambiguity by explicitly casting your value to a supported argument type. For
example, in the following code, we want to call the overloaded `foo()` function,
but both implementations accept an argument that supports [implicit
conversion](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#constructors-and-implicit-conversion)
from `StringLiteral`. So, the call to `foo(string)` is ambiguous and creates a
compiler error. We can fix it by casting the value to the type we really want:

```mojo
@value
struct MyString:
    fn __init__(out self, string: StringLiteral):
        pass

fn foo(name: String):
    print("String")

fn foo(name: MyString):
    print("MyString")

fn call_foo():
    alias string: StringLiteral = "Hello"
    # foo(string) # This call is ambiguous because two `foo` functions match it
    foo(MyString(string))
```

When resolving an overloaded function, Mojo does not consider the return type
or other contextual information at the call site—only the argument types affect
which function is selected.

Overloading also works with combinations of both `fn` and `def` functions.
For example, you could define multiple `fn` function overloads and then one
or more `def` versions that don't specify all argument types, as a fallback.

:::note

Although we haven't discussed
[parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters/) yet (they're
different from function arguments, and used for compile-time metaprogramming),
you can also overload functions based on parameter types.

:::

## Return values

Return value types are declared in the signature using the
<code><strong>-></strong> <var>type</var></code> syntax. Values are
passed using the `return` keyword, which ends the function and returns the
identified value (if any) to the caller.

```mojo
def get_greeting() -> String:
    return "Hello"
```

By default, the value is returned to the caller as an owned value. As with
arguments, a return value may be [implicitly
converted](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#constructors-and-implicit-conversion) to
the named return type. For example, the previous example calls `return` with a
string literal, `"Hello"`, which is implicitly converted to a `String`.

:::note Returning a reference

A function can also return a mutable or immutable reference using a `ref` return
value. For details, see
[Lifetimes, origins, and references](/mojo/manual/values/lifetimes).

:::

### Named results

Named function results allow a function to return a value that can't be moved or
copied. Named result syntax lets you specify a named, uninitialized variable to
return to the caller using the `out` argument convention:

```mojo
def get_name_tag(owned name: String, out name_tag: NameTag):
    name_tag = NameTag(name^)
```

The `out` argument convention identifies an uninitialized variable that the
function must initialize. (This is the same as the `out` convention used in
[struct constructors](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#constructor).) A function can
have only one `out` argument. The `out` argument for a named result can appear
anywhere in the argument list, but by convention, it should be the last argument
in the list.

A function with a named result argument doesn't need to include an explicit
`return` statement, as shown above. If the function terminates without a `return`,
or at a `return` statement with no value, the value of the `out` argument is
returned to the caller. If it includes a `return` statement with a value, that
value is returned to the caller, as usual.

The fact that a function uses a named result is transparent to the caller. That
is, these two signatures are interchangeable to the caller:

```mojo
def get_name_tag(owned name: String) -> NameTag:
    ...
def get_name_tag(owned name: String, out name_tag: NameTag):
    ...
```

In both cases, the call looks like this:

```mojo
tag = get_name_tag("Judith")
```

Because the return value is assigned to this special `out` variable, it doesn't
need to be moved or copied when it's returned to the caller. This means that you
can create a function that returns a type that can't be moved or copied, and
which takes several steps to initialize:

```mojo
struct ImmovableObject:
    var name: String

    fn __init__(out self, owned name: String):
        self.name = name^

def create_immovable_object(owned name: String, out obj: ImmovableObject):
    obj = ImmovableObject(name^)
    obj.name += "!"
    # obj is implicitly returned

def main():
    my_obj = create_immutable_object("Blob")
```

By contrast, the following function with a standard return value doesn't work:

```mojo
def create_immovable_object2(owned name: String) -> ImmovableObject:
    obj = ImmovableObject(name^)
    obj.name += "!"
    return obj^ # Error: ImmovableObject is not copyable or movable
```

Because `create_immovable_object2` uses a local variable to store the object
while it's under construction, the return call requires it to be either moved
or copied to the callee. This isn't an issue if the newly-created value is
returned immediately:

```mojo
def create_immovable_object3(owned name: String) -> ImmovableObject:
    return ImmovableObject(name^) # OK
```
