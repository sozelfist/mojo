description: Using Python and Mojo together.

Mojo is still in early development and many Python features are not yet
implemented. You can't currently write everything in Mojo that you can write in
Python. And Mojo doesn't have its own ecosystem of packages yet.

To help bridge this gap, Mojo lets you import Python modules, call Python
functions, and interact with Python objects from Mojo code. The Python code
runs in a standard Python interpreter (CPython), so your existing Python code
doesn't need to change.

## Create a Python environment

To successfully integrate Python code with your Mojo project, your environment
must have a compatible Python runtime installed along with any additional
Python packages that you want to use. Currently, you can create a compatible
environment in a couple of ways:

* We recommend that you use [Magic](/magic), our package manager and
  virtual environment manager for MAX and Mojo projects. To use Magic to create
  and manage the virtual environment for your Mojo/Python project, first
  follow the instructions in [Install Magic](/magic/#install-magic).
  Then you can create a new Mojo project like this:

  ```sh
  magic init my-mojo-project --format mojoproject
  ```

  After creating the project, you can enter the project and install any
  dependencies, for example [NumPy](https://numpy.org/):

  ```sh
  cd my-mojo-project
  ```

  ```sh
  magic add "numpy>=2.0"
  ```

* Alternatively, you can also add MAX and Mojo to a
  [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) project.
  To do so, follow the steps in [Add MAX/Mojo to a conda project](/magic/conda).

* It's also possible to convert an existing conda project to Magic as documented
  in [Migrate a conda project to Magic](/magic/#migrate-a-conda-project-to-magic).

## Import a Python module

To import a Python module in Mojo, just call
[`Python.import_module()`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python/Python#import_module)
with the module name. The following shows an example of importing the standard
Python [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package:

```mojo
from python import Python

def main():
    # This is equivalent to Python's `import numpy as np`
    np = Python.import_module("numpy")

    # Now use numpy as if writing in Python
    array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    print(array)
```

Running this program produces the following output:

```
[1 2 3]
```

Assuming that you have the NumPy package installed in your
[environment](#create-a-python-environment), this imports NumPy and you can use any
of its features.

A few things to note:

* The `import_module()` method returns a reference to the module in the form of
  a [`PythonObject`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python_object/PythonObject)
  wrapper. You must store the reference in a variable and then use it as shown
  in the example above to access functions, classes, and other objects defined
  by the module. See [Mojo wrapper objects](/mojo/manual/python/types#mojo-wrapper-objects)
  for more information about the `PythonObject` type.

* Currently, you cannot import individual members (such as a single Python class
  or function). You must import the whole Python module and then access members
  through the module name.

* Mojo doesn't yet support top-level code, so the `import_module()` call must
  be inside another method. This means you may need to import a module multiple
  times or pass around a reference to the module. This works the same way as
  Python: importing the module multiple times won't run the initialization
  logic more than once, so you don't pay any performance penalty.

* `import_module()` may raise an exception (for example, if the module isn't
  installed). If you're using it inside an `fn` function, you need to either
  handle errors (using a `try/except` clause), or add the `raises` keyword to
  the function signature. You'll also see this when calling Python functions
  that may raise exceptions. (Raising exceptions is much more common in Python
  code than in the Mojo standard library, which
  [limits their use for performance reasons](/mojo/roadmap#the-standard-library-has-limited-exceptions-use).)

:::caution

[`mojo build`](/mojo/cli/build) doesn't include the Python packages used by
your Mojo project. Instead, Mojo loads the Python interpreter and Python
packages at runtime, so they must be provided in the environment where you run
the Mojo program (such as inside the Magic environment where you built the
executable). For more information, see the section above to [create a Python
environment](#create-a-python-environment).

### Import a local Python module

If you have some local Python code you want to use in Mojo, just add
the directory to the Python path and then import the module.

For example, suppose you have a Python file named `mypython.py`:

```python title="mypython.py"
import numpy as np

def gen_random_values(size, base):
    # generate a size x size array of random numbers between base and base+1
    random_array = np.random.rand(size, size)
    return random_array + base
```

Here's how you can import it and use it in a Mojo file:

```mojo title="main.mojo"
from python import Python

def main():
    Python.add_to_path("path/to/module")
    mypython = Python.import_module("mypython")

    values = mypython.gen_random_values(2, 3)
    print(values)
```

Both absolute and relative paths work with
[`add_to_path()`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python/Python#add_to_path). For example,
you can import from the local directory like this:

```mojo
Python.add_to_path(".")
```

## Call Mojo from Python

As shown above, you can call out to Python modules from Mojo. However, there's
currently no way to do the reverseâ€”import Mojo modules from Python or call Mojo
functions from Python.

This may present a challenge for using certain modules. For example, many UI
frameworks have a main event loop that makes callbacks to user-defined code
in response to UI events. This is sometimes called an "inversion of control"
pattern. Instead of your application code calling *in* to a library, the
framework code calls *out* to your application code.

This pattern doesn't work because you can't pass Mojo callbacks to a Python
module.

For example, consider the popular [Tkinter package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
The typical usage for Tkinter is something like this:

* You create a main, or "root" window for the application.
* You add one or more UI widgets to the window. The widgets can have associated
  callback functions (for example, when a button is pushed).
* You call the root window's `mainloop()` method, which listens for events,
  updates the UI, and invokes callback functions. The main loop keeps running
  until the application exits.

Since Python can't call back into Mojo, one alternative is to have the Mojo
application drive the event loop and poll for updates. The following example
uses Tkinter, but the basic approach can be applied to other packages.

First you create a Python module that defines a Tkinter interface, with a window
and single button:

```python title="myapp.py"
import tkinter as tk

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self._root = tk.Tk()
        self.clicked = False

    def click(self):
        self.clicked = True

    def create_button(self, button_text: str):
        button = tk.Button(
            master=self._root,
            text=button_text,
            command=self.click
        )
        button.place(relx=0.5, rely=0.5, anchor=tk.CENTER)

    def create(self, res: str):
        self._root.geometry(res)
        self.create_button("Hello Mojo!")

    def update(self):
        self._root.update()
```

You can call this module from Mojo like this:

```mojo title="main.mojo"
from python import Python

def button_clicked():
    print("Hi from a MojoðŸ”¥ fn!")

def main():
    Python.add_to_path(".")
    app = Python.import_module("myapp").App()
    app.create("800x600")

    while True:
        app.update()
        if app.clicked:
            button_clicked()
            app.clicked = False
```

Instead of the Python module calling the Tkinter `mainloop()` method, the Mojo
code calls the `update()` method in a loop and checks the `clicked` attribute
after each update.
