So far, we've explained how Mojo allows you to build high-performance code that
is memory safe *without* manually managing memory, using Mojo's [ownership
model](/mojo/manual/values/ownership). However, Mojo is designed for
[systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming), which
often requires manual memory management for custom data types. So, Mojo lets
you do that as you see fit. To be clear, Mojo has no reference counter and no
garbage collector.

Mojo also has no built-in data types with special privileges. All data types
in the standard library (such as [`Bool`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/bool/Bool),
[`Int`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/Int), and
[`String`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/string/String)) are implemented as
[structs](/mojo/manual/structs). You can actually write your own
replacements for these types by using low-level primitives provided by
[MLIR dialects](/mojo/notebooks/BoolMLIR).

What's great about the Mojo language is that it provides you these low-level
tools for systems programming, but within a framework that helps you build
things that are safe and easy to use from higher-level programs. That is, you
can get under the hood and write all the "unsafe" code you want, but as long as
you do so in accordance with Mojo's [value
semantics](/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics), the programmer instantiating
your type/object doesn't need to think about memory management at all, and the
behavior will be safe and predictable, thanks to [value
ownership](/mojo/manual/values/ownership).

In summary, it's the responsibility of the type author to manage the memory and
resources for each value type, by implementing specific lifecycle methods, such
as the constructor, copy constructor, move constructor, and destructor, as
necessary. Mojo doesn't create any constructors by default, although it does
add a trivial, no-op destructor for types that don't define their own.

In the following pages, we'll explain exactly how to define these lifecycle
methods in accordance with value semantics so your types play nicely with value
ownership.

## Lifecycles and lifetimes

First, let's clarify some terminology:

* The "lifecycle" of a value is defined by various [dunder
  methods](/mojo/manual/structs#special-methods) in a struct.
  Each lifecycle event is handled by a different method,
  such as the constructor (`__init__()`), the destructor (`__del__()`), the copy
  constructor (`__copyinit__()`), and the move constructor (`__moveinit__()`).
  All values that are declared with the same type have the same lifecycle.

* The "lifetime" of a variable is defined by the span of time during
  program execution in which the variable is considered valid. The life of a
  variable begins when its value is initialized (via `__init__()`,
  `__copyinit__()` or `__moveinit__()`) and ends when the value is destroyed
  (`__del__()`), or consumed in some other way (for example, as part of a
  `__moveinit__()` call).

No two values have the exact same lifetime, because every value is created and
destroyed at a different point in time (even if the difference is imperceptible).

:::note Origin type

The concept of lifetimes is related to the `origin` type, a Mojo primitive
used to track ownership. For most Mojo programming, you won't need to work with
`origin` values directly. For information, see [Lifetimes, origins and
references](/mojo/manual/values/lifetimes).

:::

The life of a value in Mojo begins when a variable is initialized and continues
up until the value is last used, at which point Mojo destroys it. Mojo destroys
every value/object as soon as it's no longer used, using an “as soon as
possible” (ASAP) destruction policy that runs after every sub-expression. The
Mojo compiler takes care of releasing resources after last use when needed.

As you might imagine, keeping track of a value's life can be difficult if a
value is shared across functions many times during the life of a program.
However, Mojo makes this predictable partly through its [value
semantics](/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics) and [value
ownership](/mojo/manual/values/ownership) (both prerequisite readings for
the following sections). The final piece of the puzzle for lifetime management
is the value lifecycle: every value (defined in a struct) needs to implement
key lifecycle methods that define how a value is created and destroyed.
