A Mojo decorator is a [higher-order
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) that modifies or
extends the behavior of a struct, a function, or some other code. Instead of
actually calling the higher-order function, you simply add the decorator (such
as the `@value` decorator) above your code (such as a struct). The Mojo
compiler then uses the decorator function to modify your code at compile time.

:::note No custom decorators

The creation of custom decorators is not yet supported. The available ones are
built directly into the compiler.

The following pages describe each built-in decorator with examples.
