title: "Parameterization: compile-time metaprogramming"
description: An introduction to parameters and compile-time metaprogramming.
---

Many languages have facilities for *metaprogramming*: that is, for writing code that
generates or modifies code. Python has facilities for dynamic metaprogramming: features
like decorators, metaclasses, and many more. These features make Python very flexible
and productive, but since they're dynamic, they come with runtime overhead. Other
languages have static or compile-time metaprogramming features, like C preprocessor
macros and C++ templates. These can be limiting and hard to use.

To support Modular's work in AI, Mojo aims to provide powerful, easy-to-use
metaprogramming with zero runtime cost. This compile-time metaprogramming uses the same
language as runtime programs, so you don't have to learn a new language—just a few new
features.

The main new feature is *parameters*. You can think of a parameter as a
compile-time variable that becomes a runtime constant. This usage of "parameter"
is probably different from what you're used to from other languages, where
"parameter" and "argument" are often used interchangeably. In Mojo, "parameter"
and "parameter expression" refer to compile-time values, and "argument" and
"expression" refer to runtime values.

In Mojo, you can add parameters to a struct or function. You can also define
named parameter expressions—aliases—that you can use as runtime constants.

## Parameterized functions

To define a *parameterized function*, add parameters in square brackets ahead
of the argument list. Each parameter is formatted just like an argument: a
parameter name, followed by a colon and a type (which is required). In the
following example, the function has a single parameter, `count` of type `Int`.

```mojo
fn repeat[count: Int](msg: String):
    @parameter
    for i in range(count):
        print(msg)
```

The [`@parameter`](/mojo/manual/decorators/parameter) directive shown here
causes the `for` loop to be evaluated at compile time. The directive only works
if the loop limits are compile-time constants. Since `count` is a parameter,
`range(count)` can be calculated at compile time.

Calling a parameterized function, you provide values for the parameters, just
like function arguments:

```mojo
repeat[3]("Hello")
```

```output
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

The compiler resolves the parameter values during compilation, and creates a
concrete version of the `repeat[]()` function for each unique parameter value.
After resolving the parameter values and unrolling the loop, the `repeat[3]()`
function would be roughly equivalent to this:

```mojo
fn repeat_3(msg: String):
    print(msg)
    print(msg)
    print(msg)
```

:::note

This doesn't represent actual code generated by the compiler. By the
time parameters are resolved, Mojo code has already been transformed to an
intermediate representation in [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/).

:::

If the compiler can't resolve all parameter values to constant values,
compilation fails.

## Parameters and generics

"Generics" refers to functions that can act on multiple types of values, or
containers that can hold multiple types of values. For example,
[`List`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list/List), can hold
different types of values, so you can have a list of `Int` values, or
a list of `String` values).

In Mojo, generics use parameters to specify types. For example, `List`
takes a type parameter, so a vector of integers is written `List[Int]`.
So all generics use parameters, but **not** everything that uses parameters is a
generic.

For example, the `repeat[]()` function in the previous section includes
parameter of type `Int`, and an argument of type `String`. It's parameterized,
but not generic. A generic function or struct is parameterized on *type*. For
example, we could rewrite `repeat[]()` to take any type of argument that
conforms to the [`Stringable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/Stringable) trait:

```mojo
fn repeat[MsgType: Stringable, count: Int](msg: MsgType):
    @parameter
    for i in range(count):
        print(str(msg))

# Must use keyword parameter for `count`
repeat[count=2](42)
```

```output
42
42
```

This updated function takes any `Stringable` type, so you can pass it an `Int`,
`String`, or `Bool` value.

You can't pass the `count` as a positional keyword without also specifying
`MsgType`. You can put `//` after `MsgType` to specify that it's always inferred
by the argument. Now you can pass the following parameter `count` positionally:

```mojo
fn repeat[MsgType: Stringable, //, count: Int](msg: MsgType):
    @parameter
    for i in range(count):
        print(str(msg))

# MsgType is always inferred, so first positional keyword `2` is passed to `count`
repeat[2](42)
```

```output
42
42
```

Mojo's support for generics is still early. You can write generic functions like
this using traits and parameters. You can also write generic collections like
`List` and `Dict`. If you're interested in learning how these types work, you
can find the source code for the standard library collection types
[on GitHub](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/nightly/stdlib/src/collections/).

## Parameterized structs

You can also add parameters to structs. You can use parameterized structs to
build generic collections. For example, a generic array type might include code
like this:

```mojo
from memory import UnsafePointer

struct GenericArray[ElementType: CollectionElement]:
    var data: UnsafePointer[ElementType]
    var size: Int

    fn __init__(out self, *elements: ElementType):
        self.size = len(elements)
        self.data = UnsafePointer[ElementType].alloc(self.size)
        for i in range(self.size):
            (self.data + i).init_pointee_move(elements[i])

    fn __del__(owned self):
        for i in range(self.size):
            (self.data + i).destroy_pointee()
        self.data.free()

    fn __getitem__(self, i: Int) raises -> ref [self] ElementType:
        if (i < self.size):
            return self.data[i]
        else:
            raise Error("Out of bounds")
```

This struct has a single parameter, `ElementType`, which is a placeholder for
the data type you want to store in the array, sometimes called a *type
parameter*. `ElementType` is typed as
[`CollectionElement`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/CollectionElement), which is a
[trait](/mojo/manual/traits) representing any type that can be copied and moved.

As with parameterized functions, you need to pass in parameter values when you
use a parameterized struct. In this case, when you create an instance of
`GenericArray`, you need to specify the type you want to store, like `Int`, or
`Float64`. (This is a little confusing, because the *parameter value* you're
passing in this case is a *type*. That's OK: a Mojo type is a valid compile-time
value.)

You'll see that `ElementType` is used throughout the struct where you'd usually
see a type name. For example, as the formal type for the `elements` in the
constructor, and the return type of the `__getitem__()` method.

Here's an example of using `GenericArray`:

```mojo
var array = GenericArray[Int](1, 2, 3, 4)
for i in range(array.size):
    print(array[i], end=" ")
```

```output
1 2 3 4
```

A parameterized struct can use the `Self` type to represent a concrete instance
of the struct (that is, with all its parameters specified). For example, you
could add a static factory method to `GenericArray` with the following
signature:

```mojo
struct GenericArray[ElementType: CollectionElement]:
    ...

    @staticmethod
    fn splat(count: Int, value: ElementType) -> Self:
        # Create a new array with count instances of the given value
```

Here, `Self` is equivalent to writing `GenericArray[ElementType]`. That is, you
can call the `splat()` method like this:

```mojo
GenericArray[Float64].splat(8, 0)
```

The method returns an instance of `GenericArray[Float64]`.

### Conditional conformance

When creating a generic struct, you might want to define some methods that
require extra features. For example, consider a collection like `GenericArray`
that holds instances of `CollectionElement`. The `CollectionElement` trait only
requires that the stored data type be copyable and movable. This imposes a lot
of limitations: you can't implement a `sort()` method because you can't
guarantee that the stored type supports the comparison operators; you can't
write a useful `__str__()` or `__repr__()` dunder method because you can't
guarantee that the stored type supports conversion to a string.

The answer to these issues is *conditional conformance*, which lets you define a
method that requires additional features. You do this by defining the `self`
value that has a more specific bound on one or more of its parameters.

For example, the following code defines a `Container` type that holds an
instance of `CollectionElement`. It also defines a `__str__()` method that can
only be called if the stored `ElementType` conforms to
`StringableCollectionElement`:

```mojo
@value
struct Container[ElementType: CollectionElement]:
    var element: ElementType

    def __str__[StrElementType: StringableCollectionElement, //](
            self: Container[StrElementType]) -> String:
        return str(self.element)

def use_container():
    float_container = Container(5)
    string_container = Container("Hello")
    print(float_container.__str__())
    print(string_container.__str__())

use_container()
```

```output
5
Hello
```

Note the signature of the `__str__()` method, which declares the `self` argument
with a more specific type. Specifically, it declares that it takes a `Container`
with an `ElementType` that conforms to the `StringableCollectionElement` trait.

```mojo
def __str__[StrElementType: StringableCollectionElement, //](
        self: Container[StrElementType]) -> String:
```

This trait must be a superset of `ElementType`'s original trait: for example,
`StringableCollectionElement` inherits from `CollectionElement`, so it includes
all of requirements of the original trait.

Note that the `use_container()` function calls the `__str__()` method directly,
rather than calling `str(float_container)`. One current limitation of
conditional conformance is that Mojo can't recognize the struct
`Container[Int]` as conforming to `Stringable`, even though the `__str__()`
method is implemented for any `ElementType` that's also `Stringable`.

### Case study: the SIMD type

For a real-world example of a parameterized type, let's look at the
[`SIMD`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd/SIMD) type from Mojo's standard library.

[Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) is a parallel processing technology built into many modern CPUs,
GPUs, and custom accelerators. SIMD allows you to perform a single operation on
multiple pieces of data at once. For example, if you want to take the square
root of each element in an array, you can use SIMD to parallelize the work.

Processors implement SIMD using low-level vector registers in hardware that hold
multiple instances of a scalar data type. In order to use the SIMD instructions
on these processors, the data must be shaped into the proper SIMD width
(data type) and length (vector size). Processors may support 512-bit or
longer SIMD vectors, and support many data types from 8-bit integers to 64-bit
floating point numbers, so it's not practical to define all of the possible SIMD
variations.

Mojo's [`SIMD`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd/SIMD) type (defined as a struct)
exposes the common SIMD operations through its methods, and makes the SIMD data
type and size values parametric. This allows you to directly map your data to
the SIMD vectors on any hardware.

Here's a cut-down (non-functional) version of Mojo's `SIMD` type definition:

```mojo
struct SIMD[type: DType, size: Int]:
    var value: … # Some low-level MLIR stuff here

    # Create a new SIMD from a number of scalars
    fn __init__(out self, *elems: SIMD[type, 1]):  ...

    # Fill a SIMD with a duplicated scalar value.
    @staticmethod
    fn splat(x: SIMD[type, 1]) -> SIMD[type, size]: ...

    # Cast the elements of the SIMD to a different elt type.
    fn cast[target: DType](self) -> SIMD[target, size]: ...

    # Many standard operators are supported.
    fn __add__(self, rhs: Self) -> Self: ...
```

So you can create and use a SIMD vector like this:

```mojo
var vector = SIMD[DType.int16, 4](1, 2, 3, 4)
vector = vector * vector
for i in range(4):
    print(vector[i], end=" ")
```

```output
1 4 9 16
```

As you can see, a simple arithmetic operator like `*` applied to a pair of
`SIMD` vector operates on the corresponding elements in each vector.

Defining each SIMD variant with parameters is great for code reuse because the
`SIMD` type can express all the different vector variants statically, instead of
requiring the language to pre-define every variant.

Because `SIMD` is a parameterized type, the `self` argument in its functions
carries those parameters—the full type name is `SIMD[type, size]`. Although
it's valid to write this out (as shown in the return type of `splat()`), this
can be verbose, so we recommend using the `Self` type (from
[PEP673](https://peps.python.org/pep-0673/)) like the `__add__` example does.

## Overloading on parameters

Functions and methods can be overloaded on their parameter signatures. The
overload resolution logic filters for candidates according to the following
rules, in order of precedence:

1. Candidates with the minimal number of implicit conversions (in both arguments
   and parameters).
2. Candidates without variadic arguments.
3. Candidates without variadic parameters.
4. Candidates with the shortest parameter signature.
5. Non-`@staticmethod` candidates (over `@staticmethod` ones, if available).

If there is more than one candidate after applying these rules, the overload
resolution fails. For example:

```mojo
@register_passable("trivial")
struct MyInt:
    """A type that is implicitly convertible to `Int`."""
    var value: Int

    @implicit
    fn __init__(out self, _a: Int):
        self.value = _a

fn foo[x: MyInt, a: Int]():
    print("foo[x: MyInt, a: Int]()")

fn foo[x: MyInt, y: MyInt]():
    print("foo[x: MyInt, y: MyInt]()")

fn bar[a: Int](b: Int):
    print("bar[a: Int](b: Int)")

fn bar[a: Int](*b: Int):
    print("bar[a: Int](*b: Int)")

fn bar[*a: Int](b: Int):
    print("bar[*a: Int](b: Int)")

fn parameter_overloads[a: Int, b: Int, x: MyInt]():
    # `foo[x: MyInt, a: Int]()` is called because it requires no implicit
    # conversions, whereas `foo[x: MyInt, y: MyInt]()` requires one.
    foo[x, a]()

    # `bar[a: Int](b: Int)` is called because it does not have variadic
    # arguments or parameters.
    bar[a](b)

    # `bar[*a: Int](b: Int)` is called because it has variadic parameters.
    bar[a, a, a](b)

parameter_overloads[1, 2, MyInt(3)]()

struct MyStruct:
    fn __init__(out self):
        pass

    fn foo(mut self):
        print("calling instance method")

    @staticmethod
    fn foo():
        print("calling static method")

fn test_static_overload():
    var a = MyStruct()
    # `foo(mut self)` takes precedence over a static method.
    a.foo()
```

```output
foo[x: MyInt, a: Int]()
bar[a: Int](b: Int)
bar[*a: Int](b: Int)
```

## Using parameterized types and functions

You can use parametric types and functions by passing values to the
parameters in square brackets. For example, for the `SIMD` type above, `type`
specifies the data type and `size` specifies the length of the SIMD vector (it
must be a power of 2):

```mojo
# Make a vector of 4 floats.
var small_vec = SIMD[DType.float32, 4](1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

# Make a big vector containing 1.0 in float16 format.
var big_vec = SIMD[DType.float16, 32](1.0)

# Do some math and convert the elements to float32.
var bigger_vec = (big_vec+big_vec).cast[DType.float32]()

# You can write types out explicitly if you want of course.
var bigger_vec2 : SIMD[DType.float32, 32] = bigger_vec

print('small_vec type:', small_vec.element_type, 'length:', len(small_vec))
print('bigger_vec2 type:', bigger_vec2.element_type, 'length:', len(bigger_vec2))
```

```output
small_vec type: float32 length: 4
bigger_vec2 type: float32 length: 32
```

Note that the `cast()` method also needs a parameter to specify the type you
want from the cast (the method definition above expects a `target` parametric
value). Thus, just as the `SIMD` struct is a generic type definition, the
`cast()` method is a generic method definition. At compile time, the compiler
creates a concrete version of the `cast()` method with the target parameter
bound to `DType.float32`.

The code above shows the use of concrete types (that is, the parameters are all
bound to known values). But the major power of parameters comes from the
ability to define parametric algorithms and types (code that uses the parameter
values). For example, here's how to define a parametric algorithm with `SIMD`
that is type- and width-agnostic:

```mojo
from math import sqrt

fn rsqrt[dt: DType, width: Int](x: SIMD[dt, width]) -> SIMD[dt, width]:
    return 1 / sqrt(x)

var v = SIMD[DType.float16, 4](42)
print(rsqrt(v))
```

```output
[0.154296875, 0.154296875, 0.154296875, 0.154296875]
```

Notice that the `x` argument is actually a `SIMD` type based on the function
parameters. The runtime program can use the value of the parameters, because the
parameters are resolved at compile-time before they are needed by the runtime
program (but compile-time parameter expressions cannot use runtime values).

### Parameter inference

The Mojo compiler can often *infer* parameter values, so you don't always have
to specify them. For example, you can call the `rsqrt()` function defined above
without any parameters:

```mojo
var v = SIMD[DType.float16, 4](33)
print(rsqrt(v))
```

```output
[0.174072265625, 0.174072265625, 0.174072265625, 0.174072265625]
```

The compiler infers its parameters based on the parametric `v`
value passed into it, as if you wrote `rsqrt[DType.float16, 4](v)` explicitly.

Mojo can also infer the values of struct parameters from the arguments passed to
a constructor or static method.

For example, consider the following struct:

```mojo
@value
struct One[Type: StringableCollectionElement]:
    var value: Type

    fn __init__(out self, value: Type):
        self.value = value

def use_one():
    s1 = One(123)
    s2 = One("Hello")
```

Note that you can create an instance of `One` without specifying the `Type`
parameter—Mojo can infer it from the `value` argument.

You can also infer parameters from a parameterized type passed to a constructor
or static method:

```mojo
struct Two[Type: StringableCollectionElement]:
    var val1: Type
    var val2: Type

    fn __init__(out self, one: One[Type], another: One[Type]):
        self.val1 = one.value
        self.val2 = another.value
        print(str(self.val1), str(self.val2))

    @staticmethod
    fn fire(thing1: One[Type], thing2: One[Type]):
        print("🔥", str(thing1.value), str(thing2.value))

def use_two():
    s3 = Two(One("infer"), One("me"))
    Two.fire(One(1), One(2))

use_two()
```

```output
infer me
🔥 1 2
```

`Two` takes a `Type` parameter, and its constructor takes values of type
`One[Type]`. When constructing an instance of `Two`, you don't need to specify
the `Type` parameter, since it can be inferred from the arguments.

Similarly, the static `fire()` method takes values of type `One[Type]`, so Mojo
can infer the `Type` value at compile time.

:::note

If you're familiar with C++, you may recognize this as similar to Class Template
Argument Deduction (CTAD).

:::

## Optional parameters and keyword parameters

Just as you can specify [optional
arguments](/mojo/manual/functions#optional-arguments) in function signatures,
you can also define an optional *parameter* by giving it a default value.

You can also pass parameters by keyword, just like you can use
[keyword arguments](/mojo/manual/functions#keyword-arguments).
For a function or struct with multiple optional parameters, using keywords
allows you to pass only the parameters you want to specify, regardless of
their position in the function signature.

For example, here's a function with two parameters, each with a default value:

```mojo
fn speak[a: Int = 3, msg: StringLiteral = "woof"]():
    print(msg, a)

fn use_defaults() raises:
    speak()             # prints 'woof 3'
    speak[5]()          # prints 'woof 5'
    speak[7, "meow"]()  # prints 'meow 7'
    speak[msg="baaa"]() # prints 'baaa 3'
```

Recall that when a parametric function is called, Mojo can infer the parameter values.
That is, it can use the parameter values attached to an argument value (see the
`sqrt[]()` example above). If the parametric function also has a default value defined,
then the inferred parameter type takes precedence.

For example, in the following code, we update the parametric `speak[]()` function
to take an argument with a parametric type. Although the function has a default
parameter value for `a`, Mojo instead uses the inferred `a` parameter value
from the `bar` argument (as written, the default `a` value can never be used,
but this is just for demonstration purposes):

```mojo
@value
struct Bar[v: Int]:
    pass

fn speak[a: Int = 3, msg: StringLiteral = "woof"](bar: Bar[a]):
    print(msg, a)

fn use_inferred():
    speak(Bar[9]())  # prints 'woof 9'
```

As mentioned above, you can also use optional parameters and keyword
parameters in a struct:

```mojo
struct KwParamStruct[greeting: String = "Hello", name: String = "🔥mojo🔥"]:
    fn __init__(out self):
        print(greeting, name)

fn use_kw_params():
    var a = KwParamStruct[]()                 # prints 'Hello 🔥mojo🔥'
    var b = KwParamStruct[name="World"]()     # prints 'Hello World'
    var c = KwParamStruct[greeting="Hola"]()  # prints 'Hola 🔥mojo🔥'
```

:::note

Mojo supports positional-only and keyword-only parameters, following the same
rules as [positional-only and keyword-only
arguments](/mojo/manual/functions#positional-only-and-keyword-only-arguments).

:::

## Infer-only parameters

Sometimes you need to declare functions where parameters depend on other
parameters. Because the signature is processed left to right, a parameter can
only *depend* on a parameter earlier in the parameter list. For example:

```mojo
fn dependent_type[dtype: DType, value: Scalar[dtype]]():
    print("Value: ", value)
    print("Value is floating-point: ", dtype.is_floating_point())

dependent_type[DType.float64, Float64(2.2)]()
```

```output
Value:  2.2000000000000002
Value is floating-point:  True
```

You can't reverse the position of the `dtype` and `value` parameters, because
`value` depends on `dtype`. However, because `dtype` is a required parameter,
you can't leave it out of the parameter list and let Mojo infer it from `value`:

```mojo
dependent_type[Float64(2.2)]() # Error!
```

Infer-only parameters are a special class of parameters that are **always** either
inferred from context or specified by keyword. Infer-only parameters are placed at the
**beginning** of the parameter list, set off from other parameters by the `//` sigil:

```mojo
fn example[type: CollectionElement, //, list: List[type]]()
```

Transforming `dtype` into an infer-only parameter solves this problem:

```mojo
fn dependent_type[dtype: DType, //, value: Scalar[dtype]]():
    print("Value: ", value)
    print("Value is floating-point: ", dtype.is_floating_point())

dependent_type[Float64(2.2)]()
```

```output
Value:  2.2000000000000002
Value is floating-point:  True
```

Because infer-only parameters are declared at the beginning of the parameter
list, other parameters can depend on them, and the compiler will always attempt
to infer the infer-only values from bound parameters or arguments.

There are sometimes cases where it's useful to specify an infer-only parameter by
keyword. For example, the [`StringSlice`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/string_slice/StringSlice)
type is parametric on [origin](/mojo/manual/values/lifetimes):

```mojo
struct StringSlice[is_mutable: Bool, //, origin: Origin[is_mutable]]: ...
```

Here, the `StringSlice` `is_mutable` parameter is infer-only. The value is usually
inferred when you create an instance of `StringSlice`. Binding the `is_mutable`
parameter by keyword lets you define a new type that's constrained to an
immutable origin:

```mojo
alias ImmutableStringSlice = StringSlice[is_mutable=False]
```

If the compiler can't infer the value of an infer-only parameter, and it's not
specified by keyword, compilation fails.

## Variadic parameters

Mojo also supports variadic parameters, similar to
[Variadic arguments](/mojo/manual/functions#variadic-arguments):

```mojo
struct MyTensor[*dimensions: Int]:
    pass
```

Variadic parameters currently have some limitations that variadic arguments don't have:

* Variadic parameters must be homogeneous—that is, all the values must be the
  same type.

* The parameter type must be register-passable.

* The parameter values aren't automatically projected into a `VariadicList`, so you
  need to construct the list explicitly:

```mojo
fn sum_params[*values: Int]() -> Int:
    alias list = VariadicList(values)
    var sum = 0
    for v in list:
        sum += v
    return sum
```

Variadic keyword parameters (for example, `**kwparams`) are
not supported yet.

## Parameter expressions are just Mojo code

A parameter expression is any code expression (such as `a+b`) that occurs where
a parameter is expected. Parameter expressions support operators and function
calls, just like runtime code, and all parameter types use the same type
system as the runtime program (such as `Int` and `DType`).

Because parameter expressions use the same grammar and types as runtime
Mojo code, you can use many
["dependent type"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type) features. For
example, you might want to define a helper function to concatenate two SIMD
vectors:

```mojo
fn concat[ty: DType, len1: Int, len2: Int](
        lhs: SIMD[ty, len1], rhs: SIMD[ty, len2]) -> SIMD[ty, len1+len2]:

    var result = SIMD[ty, len1 + len2]()
    for i in range(len1):
        result[i] = SIMD[ty, 1](lhs[i])
    for j in range(len2):
        result[len1 + j] = SIMD[ty, 1](rhs[j])
    return result

var a = SIMD[DType.float32, 2](1, 2)
var x = concat(a, a)

print('result type:', x.element_type, 'length:', len(x))
```

```output
result type: float32 length: 4
```

Note that the resulting length is the sum of the input vector lengths, and this is
expressed with a simple `+` operation.

### Powerful compile-time programming

While simple expressions are useful, sometimes you want to write imperative
compile-time logic with control flow. You can even do compile-time recursion.
For instance, here is an example "tree reduction" algorithm that sums all
elements of a vector recursively into a scalar:

```mojo
fn slice[ty: DType, new_size: Int, size: Int](
        x: SIMD[ty, size], offset: Int) -> SIMD[ty, new_size]:
    var result = SIMD[ty, new_size]()
    for i in range(new_size):
        result[i] = SIMD[ty, 1](x[i + offset])
    return result

fn reduce_add[ty: DType, size: Int](x: SIMD[ty, size]) -> Int:
    @parameter
    if size == 1:
        return int(x[0])
    elif size == 2:
        return int(x[0]) + int(x[1])

    # Extract the top/bottom halves, add them, sum the elements.
    alias half_size = size // 2
    var lhs = slice[ty, half_size, size](x, 0)
    var rhs = slice[ty, half_size, size](x, half_size)
    return reduce_add[ty, half_size](lhs + rhs)

var x = SIMD[DType.index, 4](1, 2, 3, 4)
print(x)
print("Elements sum:", reduce_add(x))
```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4]
Elements sum: 10
```

This makes use of the [`@parameter`](/mojo/manual/decorators/parameter) decorator to
create a parametric if condition, which is an `if` statement that runs at compile-time.
It requires that its condition be a valid parameter expression, and ensures that only
the live branch of the `if` statement is compiled into the program. (This is similar to
use of the `@parameter` decorator with a `for` loop shown earlier.)

## Mojo types are just parameter expressions

While we've shown how you can use parameter expressions within types, type
annotations can themselves be arbitrary expressions (just like in Python).
Types in Mojo have a special metatype type, allowing type-parametric algorithms
and functions to be defined.

For example, we can create a simplified `Array` that supports arbitrary types of
elements (via the `AnyTrivialRegType` parameter):

```mojo
from memory import UnsafePointer

struct Array[T: AnyTrivialRegType]:
    var data: UnsafePointer[T]
    var size: Int

    fn __init__(out self, size: Int, value: T):
        self.size = size
        self.data = UnsafePointer[T].alloc(self.size)
        for i in range(self.size):
            (self.data + i).init_pointee_copy(value)

    fn __getitem__(self, i: Int) -> T:
        return self.data[i]

    fn __del__(owned self):
        for i in range(self.size):
            (self.data + i).destroy_pointee()
        self.data.free()

var v = Array[Float32](4, 3.14)
print(v[0], v[1], v[2], v[3])
```

Notice that the `T` parameter is being used as the formal type for the
`value` arguments and the return type of the `__getitem__()` function.
Parameters allow the `Array` type to provide different APIs based on the
different use-cases.

There are many other cases that benefit from more advanced use of parameters.
For example, you can execute a closure N times in parallel, feeding in a value
from the context, like this:

```mojo
fn parallelize[func: fn (Int) -> None](num_work_items: Int):
    # Not actually parallel: see the 'algorithm' module for real implementation.
    for i in range(num_work_items):
        func(i)
```

Another example where this is important is with variadic generics, where an
algorithm or data structure may need to be defined over a list of heterogeneous
types such as for a tuple. Right now, this is not fully supported in Mojo and
requires writing some MLIR by hand. In the future, this will be possible in pure
Mojo.

## `alias`: named parameter expressions

It is very common to want to *name* compile-time values. Whereas `var` defines a
runtime value, we need a way to define a
compile-time temporary value. For this, Mojo uses an `alias` declaration.

For example, the [`DType`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/dtype/DType) struct
implements a simple enum using aliases for the enumerators like this (the actual
`DType` implementation details vary a bit):

```mojo
struct DType:
    var value : UI8
    alias invalid = DType(0)
    alias bool = DType(1)
    alias int8 = DType(2)
    alias uint8 = DType(3)
    alias int16 = DType(4)
    alias int16 = DType(5)
    ...
    alias float32 = DType(15)
```

This allows clients to use `DType.float32` as a parameter expression (which also
works as a runtime value) naturally. Note that this is invoking the
runtime constructor for `DType` at compile-time.

Types are another common use for aliases. Because types are compile-time
expressions, it is handy to be able to do things like this:

```mojo
alias Float16 = SIMD[DType.float16, 1]
alias UInt8 = SIMD[DType.uint8, 1]

var x: Float16 = 0  # Float16 works like a "typedef"
```

Like `var` variables, aliases obey scope, and you can use local aliases within
functions as you'd expect.

## Fully-bound, partially-bound, and unbound types

A parametric type with its parameters specified is said to be *fully-bound*.
That is, all of its parameters are bound to values. As mentioned before, you can
only instantiate a fully-bound type (sometimes called a *concrete type*).

However, parametric types can be *unbound* or *partially bound* in some
contexts. For example, you can alias a partially-bound type to create a new type
that requires fewer parameters:

```mojo
from collections import Dict

alias StringKeyDict = Dict[String, _]
var b = StringKeyDict[UInt8]()
b["answer"] = 42
```

Here, `StringKeyDict` is a type alias for a `Dict` that takes `String` keys. The
underscore `_` in the parameter list indicates that the second parameter,
`V` (the value type), is unbound.
You specify the `V` parameter later, when you use `StringKeyDict`.

For example, given the following type:

```mojo
struct MyType[s: String, i: Int, i2: Int, b: Bool = True]:
    pass
```

It can appear in code in the following forms:

* *Fully bound*, with all of its parameters specified:

  ```mojo
  MyType["Hello", 3, 4, True]
  ```

* *Partially bound*, with *some but not all* of its parameters specified:

  ```mojo
  MyType["Hola", _, _, True]
  ```

* *Unbound*, with no parameters specified:

  ```mojo
  MyType[_, _, _, _]
  ```

You can also use the star-underscore expression `*_` to unbind an arbitrary
number of positional parameters at the end of a parameter
list.

```mojo
# These two types are equivalent
MyType["Hello", *_]
MyType["Hello", _, _, _]
```

The `*_` expression specifically matches any parameters that can be specified by
position (positional-only or positional-or-keyword). To unbind keyword-only parameters,
use the double-star-underscore expression, `**_`, which matches any parameters that can
be specified by keyword (positional-or-keyword or keyword-only).

```mojo
@value
struct KeyWordStruct[pos_or_kw: Int, *, kw_only: Int = 10]:
    pass

# Unbind both pos_or_kw and kw_only parameters
fn use_kw_struct(k: KeyWordStruct[**_]):
    pass

def main():
    use_kw_struct(KeyWordStruct[10, kw_only=11]())
```

When a parameter is explicitly unbound with the `_`, `*_`, or `**_` expressions, you
**must** specify a value for that parameter to use the type. Any default value from the
original type declaration is ignored.

Partially-bound and unbound parametric types can be used in some contexts where
the missing (unbound) parameters will be supplied later—such as in
[aliases](#alias-named-parameter-expressions) and
[automatically parameterized functions](#automatic-parameterization-of-functions).

### Omitted parameters

Mojo also supports an alternate format for unbound parameter where the parameter
is simply omitted from the expression:

```mojo
# Partially bound
MyType["Hi there"]
# Unbound
MyType
```

This format differs from the explicit unbinding syntax described above in that
the default values for omitted parameters are bound immediately. For example,
the following expressions are equivalent:

```mojo
MyType["Hi there"]
# equivalent to
MyType["Hi there", _, _, True] # Uses the default value for `b`
```

:::note

This format is currently supported for backwards compatibility. We intend to
deprecate this format in the future in favor of the explicit unbinding syntax.

:::

## Automatic parameterization of functions

Mojo  supports "automatic" parameterization of functions. If a function
argument type is a
[partially-bound or unbound type](#fully-bound-partially-bound-and-unbound-types),
the unbound parameters are automatically added as input parameters on the
function. This is easier to understand with an example:

```mojo
fn print_params(vec: SIMD[*_]):
    print(vec.type)
    print(vec.size)

var v = SIMD[DType.float64, 4](1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)
print_params(v)
```

```output
float64
4
```

In the above example, the `print_params` function is automatically
parameterized. The `vec` argument takes an argument of type `SIMD[*_]`. This is
an [unbound parameterized
type](#fully-bound-partially-bound-and-unbound-types)—that is, it doesn't
specify any parameter values for the type. Mojo treats the unbound parameters
on `vec` as infer-only parameters on the function. This is roughly equivalent to
the following codes:

```mojo
fn print_params[t: DType, s: Int, //](vec: SIMD[t, s]):
    print(vec.type)
    print(vec.size)
```

When you call `print_params()` you must pass it a concrete instance of the
`SIMD`  type—that is, one with all of its parameters specified, like
`SIMD[DType.float64, 4]`. The Mojo compiler *infers* the parameter
values from the input argument.

With a manually parameterized function, you can access the input parameters by
name (for example, `t` and `s` in the previous example). For an
automatically parameterized function, you can access the parameters as
attributes on the argument (for example, `vec.type`).

This ability to access a type's input parameters is not specific to
automatically parameterized functions, you can use it anywhere. You can access
the input parameters of a parameterized type as attributes on the type itself:

```mojo
fn on_type():
    print(SIMD[DType.float32, 2].size) # prints 2
```

Or as attributes on an *instance* of the type:

```mojo
fn on_instance():
    var x = SIMD[DType.int32, 2](4, 8)
    print(x.type) # prints int32
```

You can even use this syntax in the function's signature to define a
function's arguments and return type based on an argument's parameters.
For example, if you want your function to take two SIMD vectors with the same
type and size, you can write code like this:

```mojo
fn interleave(v1: SIMD, v2: __type_of(v1)) -> SIMD[v1.type, v1.size*2]:
    var result = SIMD[v1.type, v1.size*2]()
    for i in range(v1.size):
        result[i*2] = SIMD[v1.type, 1](v1[i])
        result[i*2+1] = SIMD[v1.type, 1](v2[i])
    return result

var a = SIMD[DType.int16, 4](1, 2, 3, 4)
var b = SIMD[DType.int16, 4](0, 0, 0, 0)
var c = interleave(a, b)
print(c)
```

```output
[1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0]
```

As shown in the example, you can use the magic `__type_of(x)` call if you just want to
match the type of an argument. In this case, it's more convenient and compact that
writing the equivalent `SIMD[v1.type, v1.size]`.

### Automatic parameterization of parameters

You can also take advantage of automatic parameterization in a function's
parameter list. For example:

```mojo
fn foo[value: SIMD]():
    pass

# Equivalent to:
fn foo[type: DType, size: Int, //, value: SIMD[type, size]]():
    pass
```

### Automatic parameterization with partially-bound types

Mojo also supports automatic parameterization: with [partially-bound
parameterized types](#fully-bound-partially-bound-and-unbound-types) (that is,
types with some but not all of the parameters specified).

For example, suppose we have a `Fudge` struct with three parameters:

```mojo
@value
struct Fudge[sugar: Int, cream: Int, chocolate: Int = 7](Stringable):
    fn __str__(self) -> String:
        return str("Fudge (") + str(sugar) + "," +
            str(cream) + "," + str(chocolate) + ")"

```

We can write a function that takes a `Fudge` argument with just one bound
parameter (it's *partially bound*):

```mojo
fn eat(f: Fudge[5, *_]):
    print("Ate " + str(f))
```

The `eat()` function takes a `Fudge` struct with the first parameter (`sugar`)
bound to the value 5. The second and third parameters, `cream` and `chocolate`
are unbound.

The unbound `cream` and `chocolate` parameters become implicit input parameters
on the `eat` function. In practice, this is roughly equivalent to writing:

```mojo
fn eat[cr: Int, ch: Int](f: Fudge[5, cr, ch]):
    print("Ate", str(f))
```

In both cases, we can call the function by passing in an instance with the
`cream` and `chocolate` parameters bound:

```mojo
eat(Fudge[5, 5, 7]())
eat(Fudge[5, 8, 9]())
```

```output
Ate Fudge (5,5,7)
Ate Fudge (5,8,9)
```

If you try to pass in an argument with a `sugar` value other than 5,
compilation fails, because it doesn't match the argument type:

```mojo
eat(Fudge[12, 5, 7]())
# ERROR: invalid call to 'eat': argument #0 cannot be converted from 'Fudge[12, 5, 7]' to 'Fudge[5, 5, 7]'
```

You can also explicitly unbind individual parameters. This gives you
more freedom in specifying unbound parameters.

For example, you might want to let the user specify values for `sugar` and
`chocolate`, and leave `cream` constant. To do this, replace each unbound
parameter value with a single underscore (`_`):

```mojo
fn devour(f: Fudge[_, 6, _]):
    print("Devoured",  str(f))
```

Again, the unbound parameters (`sugar` and `chocolate`) are added as implicit
input parameters on the function. This version is roughly equivalent to the
following code, where these two values are explicitly bound to the input
parameters, `su` and `ch`:

```mojo
fn devour[su: Int, ch: Int](f: Fudge[su, 6, ch]):
    print("Devoured", str(f))
```

You can also specify parameters by keyword, or mix positional and keyword
parameters, so the following function is roughly equivalent to the previous one:
the first parameter, `sugar` is explicitly unbound with the underscore character.
The `chocolate` parameter is unbound using the keyword syntax, `chocolate=_`.
And `cream` is explicitly bound to the value 6:

```mojo
fn devour(f: Fudge[_, chocolate=_, cream=6]):
    print("Devoured",  str(f))
```

All three versions of the `devour()` function work with the following calls:

```mojo
devour(Fudge[3, 6, 9]())
devour(Fudge[4, 6, 8]())
```

```output
Devoured Fudge (3,6,9)
Devoured Fudge (4,6,8)
```

### Legacy syntax (omitted parameters)

You can also specify an unbound or partially-bound type by omitting parameters:
for example:

```mojo
fn nibble(f: Fudge[5]):
    print("Ate", str(f))

nibble(Fudge[5, 4, 7]())

```

```output
Ate Fudge (5,4,7)
```

Here, `Fudge[5]` works like `Fudge[5, *_]` **except** in the handling of
parameters with default values. Instead of discarding the default value of
`chocolate`, `Fudge[5]` binds the default value immediately, making it
equivalent to: `Fudge[5, _, 7]`.

This means that the following code won't compile with the previous definition
for the `nibble()` function, since it doesn't use the default value for
`chocolate`:

```mojo
nibble(Fudge[5, 5, 9]())
# ERROR: invalid call to 'nibble': argument #0 cannot be converted from 'Fudge[5, 5, 9]' to 'Fudge[5, 5, 7]'
```

:::note TODO

Support for omitting unbound parameters will eventually be deprecated in
favor of explicitly unbound parameters using `_` and `*_`.

:::

## The `rebind()` builtin

One of the consequences of Mojo not performing function instantiation in the
parser like C++ is that Mojo cannot always figure out whether some parametric
types are equal and complain about an invalid conversion. This typically occurs
in static dispatch patterns. For example, the following code won't compile:

```mojo
fn take_simd8(x: SIMD[DType.float32, 8]):
    pass

fn generic_simd[nelts: Int](x: SIMD[DType.float32, nelts]):
    @parameter
    if nelts == 8:
        take_simd8(x)
```

The parser will complain:

```plaintext
error: invalid call to 'take_simd8': argument #0 cannot be converted from
'SIMD[f32, nelts]' to 'SIMD[f32, 8]'
        take_simd8(x)
        ~~~~~~~~~~^~~
```

This is because the parser fully type-checks the function without instantiation,
and the type of `x` is still `SIMD[f32, nelts]`, and not `SIMD[f32, 8]`, despite
the static conditional. The remedy is to manually "rebind" the type of `x`,
using the `rebind` builtin, which inserts a compile-time assert that the input
and result types resolve to the same type after function instantiation:

```mojo
fn take_simd8(x: SIMD[DType.float32, 8]):
    pass

fn generic_simd[nelts: Int](x: SIMD[DType.float32, nelts]):
    @parameter
    if nelts == 8:
        take_simd8(rebind[SIMD[DType.float32, 8]](x))
```
