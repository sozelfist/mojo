description: How Mojo shares references through function arguments.
---

A challenge you might face when using some programming languages is that you
must manually allocate and deallocate memory. When multiple parts of the
program need access to the same memory, it becomes difficult to keep track of
who "owns" a value and determine when is the right time to deallocate it. If
you make a mistake, it can result in a "use-after-free" error, a "double free"
error, or a "leaked memory" error, any one of which can be catastrophic.

Mojo helps avoid these errors by ensuring there is only one variable that owns
each value at a time, while still allowing you to share references with other
functions. When the life span of the owner ends, Mojo [destroys the
value](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/death). Programmers are still responsible for
making sure any type that allocates resources (including memory) also
deallocates those resources in its destructor. Mojo's ownership system ensures
that destructors are called promptly.

On this page, we'll explain the rules that govern this ownership model, and how
to specify different argument conventions that define how values are passed into
functions.

## Ownership summary

The fundamental rules that make Mojo's ownership model work are the following:

* Every value has only one owner at a time.
* When the lifetime of the owner ends, Mojo destroys the value.
* If there are existing references to a value, Mojo extends the lifetime of
  the owner.

### Variables and references

A variable *owns* its value. A struct owns its fields.

A *reference* allows you to access a value owned by another variable. A
reference can have either mutable access or immutable access to that value.

Mojo references are created when you call a function: function arguments can be
passed as mutable or immutable references. A function can also return a
reference instead of returning a value.

## Argument conventions

In all programming languages, code quality and performance is heavily dependent
upon how functions treat argument values. That is, whether a value received by
a function is a unique value or a reference, and whether it's mutable or
immutable, has a series of consequences that define the readability,
performance, and safety of the language.

In Mojo, we want to provide full [value
semantics](/mojo/manual/values/value-semantics) by default, which provides
consistent and predictable behavior. But as a systems programming language, we
also need to offer full control over memory optimizations, which generally
requires reference semantics. The trick is to introduce reference semantics in
a way that ensures all code is memory safe by tracking the lifetime of every
value and destroying each one at the right time (and only once). All of this is
made possible in Mojo through the use of argument conventions that ensure every
value has only one owner at a time.

An argument convention specifies whether an argument is mutable or immutable,
and whether the function owns the value. Each convention is defined by a
keyword at the beginning of an argument declaration:

* `read`: The function receives an **immutable reference**. This means the
  function can read the original value (it is *not* a copy), but it cannot
  mutate (modify) it. `def` functions treat this differently, as described below.

* `mut`: The function receives a **mutable reference**. This means the
  function can read and mutate the original value (it is *not* a copy).

* `owned`: The function takes **ownership** of a value. This means the function
  has exclusive ownership of the argument. The caller might choose to transfer
  ownership of an existing value to this function, but that's not always what
  happens. The callee might receive a newly-created value, or a copy of an
  existing value.

* `ref`: The function gets a reference with an parametric mutability: that is,
  the reference can be either mutable or immutable. You can think of `ref`
  arguments as a generalization of the `read` and `mut` conventions.
  `ref` arguments are an advanced topic, and they're described in more detail in
  [Lifetimes and references](/mojo/manual/values/lifetimes).

* `out`: A special convention used for the `self` argument in
  [constructors](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#constructor) and for
  [named results](/mojo/manual/functions#named-function-results). An `out`
  argument is uninitialized at the beginning of the function, and must be
  initialized before the function returns. Although `out` arguments show up in
  the argument list, they're never passed in by the caller.

For example, this function has one argument that's a mutable
reference and one that's immutable:

```mojo
fn add(mut x: Int, read y: Int):
    x += y

fn main():
    var a = 1
    var b = 2
    add(a, b)
    print(a)  # Prints 3
```

You've probably already seen some function arguments that don't declare a
convention. by default, all arguments are `read`.
In the following sections, we'll explain each of these argument conventions in
more detail.

## Borrowed arguments (`read`)

The `read` convention is the default for all arguments. But `def` and `fn`
functions treat `read` arguments somewhat differently:

* In a [`def` function](/mojo/manual/functions#def-functions), if you mutate
  the value in the body of the function, the function receives a mutable copy of
  the  argument. Otherwise, it receives an immutable reference. This allows you
  to treat arguments as mutable, but avoid the overhead of making extra copies when
  they're not needed.

* In an [`fn` function](/mojo/manual/functions#fn-functions), the function
  always receives an immutable reference. If you want a mutable copy, you can
  assign it to a local variable:

  ```mojo
  var my_copy = read_arg
  ```

In both cases, the original value on the caller side can't be changed by the
callee.

For example:

```mojo
from collections import List

def print_list(list: List[Int]):
    print(list.__str__())

var list = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
print_list(list)

```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Here the `list` argument to `print_list()` is read and not mutated, so the
`print_list()` function gets an immutable reference to the original `List`, and
doesn't do any copying.

In general, passing an immutable reference is much more efficient
when handling large or expensive-to-copy values, because the copy constructor
and destructor are not invoked for a `read` argument.

### Compared to C++ and Rust

Mojo's read argument convention is similar in some ways to passing an
argument by `const&` in C++, which also avoids a copy of the value and disables
mutability in the callee. However, the read convention differs from
`const&` in C++ in two important ways:

* The Mojo compiler implements a lifetime checker that ensures that values are
  not destroyed when there are outstanding references to those values.

* Small values like `Int`, `Float`, and `SIMD` are passed directly in machine
  registers instead of through an extra indirection (this is because they are
  declared with the `@register_passable` decorator). This is a [significant
  performance
  enhancement](https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/should-small-rust-structs-be-passed-by-copy-or-by-borrow/)
  when compared to languages like C++ and Rust, and moves this optimization from
  every call site to a declaration on the type definition.

The major difference between Rust and Mojo is that Mojo does not require a sigil
on the caller side to pass by immutable reference. Also, Mojo is more efficient
when passing small values, and Rust defaults to moving values instead of passing
them around by borrow. These policy and syntax decisions allow Mojo to provide
an easier-to-use programming model.

## Mutable arguments (`mut`)

If you'd like your function to receive a **mutable reference**, add the `mut`
keyword in front of the argument name. You can think of `mut` like this: it
means any changes to the value *in*side the function are visible *out*side the
function.

For example, this `mutate()` function updates the original `list` value:

```mojo
from collections import List

def mutate(mut l: List[Int]):
    l.append(5)

var list = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

mutate(list)
print_list(list)
```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

That behaves like an optimized replacement for this:

```mojo
from collections import List

def mutate_copy(l: List[Int]) -> List[Int]:
    l.append(5)
    return l

var list = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
list = mutate_copy(list)
print_list(list)
```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Although the code using `mut` isn't that much shorter, it's more memory
efficient because it does not make a copy of the value.

However, remember that the values passed as `mut` must already be mutable.
For example, if you try to take a `read` value and pass it to another
function as `mut`, you'll get a compiler error because Mojo can't form a
mutable reference from an immutable reference.

:::note

You cannot define [default
values](/mojo/manual/functions#optional-arguments) for `mut`
arguments.

### Argument exclusivity

Mojo enforces *argument exclusivity* for mutable references. This means that if
a function receives a mutable reference to a value (such as an `mut` argument),
it can't receive any other references to the same valueâ€”mutable or immutable.
That is, a mutable reference can't have any other references that *alias* it.

For example, consider the following code example:

```mojo
fn append_twice(mut s: String, other: String):
   # Mojo knows 's' and 'other' cannot be the same string.
   s += other
   s += other

fn invalid_access():
  var my_string = str("o")

  # error: passing `my_string` mut is invalid since it is also passed
  # read.
  append_twice(my_string, my_string)
  print(my_string)
```

This code is confusing because the user might expect the output to be `ooo`,
but since the first addition mutates both `s` and `other`, the actual output
would be `oooo`. Enforcing exclusivity of mutable references not only prevents
coding errors, it also allows the Mojo compiler to optimize code in some cases.

One way to avoid this issue when you do need both a mutable and an immutable
reference (or need to pass the same value to two arguments) is to make a copy:

```mojo
fn valid_access():
  var my_string = str("o")
  var other_string = str(my_string)
  append_twice(my_string, other_string)
  print(my_string)
```

Note that argument exclusivity isn't enforced for register-passable trivial
types (like `Int` and `Bool`), because they are always passed by copy. When
passing the same value into two `Int` arguments, the callee will receive two
copies of the value.

## Transfer arguments (`owned` and `^`)

And finally, if you'd like your function to receive value **ownership**, add the
`owned` keyword in front of the argument name.

This convention is often combined with use of the postfixed `^` "transfer"
sigil on the variable that is passed into the function, which ends the
lifetime of that variable.

Technically, the `owned` keyword does not guarantee that the received value is
*the original value*â€”it guarantees only that the function
gets unique ownership of a value. This happens in one of
three ways:

* The caller passes the argument with the `^` transfer sigil, which ends the
  lifetime of that variable (the variable becomes uninitialized) and ownership
  is transferred into the function.

* The caller **does not** use the `^` transfer sigil, in which case, Mojo copies
  the value. If the type isn't copyable, this is a compile-time error.

* The caller passes in a newly-created "owned" value, such as a value returned
  from a function. In this case, no variable owns the value and it can be
  transferred directly to the callee. For example:

  ```mojo
  def take(owned s: String):
      pass

  take(String("A brand-new String!"))
  ```

The following code works by making a copy of the string, because `take_text()`
uses the `owned` convention, and the caller does not include the transfer sigil:

```mojo
fn take_text(owned text: String):
    text += "!"
    print(text)

fn my_function():
    var message: String = "Hello"
    take_text(message)
    print(message)

my_function()
```

```output
Hello!
Hello
```

However, if you add the `^` transfer sigil when calling `take_text()`, the
compiler complains about `print(message)`, because at that point, the `message`
variable is no longer initialized. That is, this version does not compile:

```mojo
fn my_function():
    var message: String = "Hello"
    take_text(message^)
    print(message)  # ERROR: The `message` variable is uninitialized
```

This is a critical feature of Mojo's lifetime checker, because it ensures that no
two variables can have ownership of the same value. To fix the error, you must
not use the `message` variable after you end its lifetime with the `^` transfer
operator. So here is the corrected code:

```mojo

fn my_function():
    var message: String = "Hello"
    take_text(message^)

my_function()
```

```output
Hello!
```

Regardless of how it receives the value, when the function declares an argument
as `owned`, it can be certain that it has unique mutable access to that value.
Because the value is owned, the value is destroyed when the function
exitsâ€”unless the function transfers the value elsewhere.

For example, in the following example, `add_to_list()` takes a string and
appends it to the list. Ownership of the string is transferred to the list, so
it's not destroyed when the function exits. On the other hand,
`consume_string()` doesn't transfer its `owned` value out, so the value is
destroyed at the end of the function.

```mojo
from collections import List

def add_to_list(owned name: String, mut list: List[String]):
    list.append(name^)
    # name is uninitialized, nothing to destroy

def consume_string(owned s: String):
    print(s)
    # s is destroyed here
```

:::note

Value lifetimes are not fully implemented for top-level code in
Mojo's REPL, so the transfer sigil currently works as intended only when
used inside a function.

:::

### Transfer implementation details

In Mojo, you shouldn't conflate "ownership transfer" with a "move
operation"â€”these are not strictly the same thing.

There are multiple ways that Mojo can transfer ownership of a value:

* If a type implements the [move
  constructor](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#move-constructor),
  `__moveinit__()`, Mojo may invoke this method *if* a value of that type is
  transferred into a function as an `owned` argument, *and* the original
  variable's lifetime ends at the same point (with or without use of the `^`
  transfer sigil).

* If a type implements the [copy
  constructor](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#move-constructor), `__copyinit__()`
  and not `__moveinit__()`, Mojo may copy the value and destroy the old value.

* In some cases, Mojo can optimize away the move operation entirely, leaving the
  value in the same memory location but updating its ownership. In these cases,
  a value can be transferred without invoking either the `__copyinit__()` or
  `__moveinit__()` constructors.

In order for the `owned` convention to work *without* the transfer
sigil, the value type must be copyable (via `__copyinit__()`).

## Comparing `def` and `fn` argument conventions

As mentioned in the section about
[functions](/mojo/manual/functions), `def` and `fn` functions
are interchangeable, as far as a caller is concerned, and they can both
accomplish the same things. It's only the inside that differs, and Mojo's `def`
function is essentially just sugaring for the `fn` function:

* A `def` argument without a type annotation defaults to
  [`object`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/object/object) type (whereas as `fn`
  requires all types be explicitly declared).

* A `def` function can treat a `read` argument as mutable (in which case it
  receives a mutable copy). An `fn` function must make this copy explicitly.

For example, these two functions have the exact same behavior.

```mojo
def def_example(a: Int, mut b: Int, owned c):
    pass

fn fn_example(a_in: Int, mut b: Int, owned c: object):
    var a = a_in
    pass
```

This shadow copy typically adds no overhead, because small types
like `object` are cheap to copy. However, copying large types that allocate heap
storage can be expensive. (For example, copying `List` or `Dict` types, or
copying large numbers of strings.)

### `read` versus `owned` in `def` functions

The difference between `read` and `owned` in a `def` function may be a
little subtle. In both cases, you can end up with a uniquely-owned value that's
a copy of the original value.

* The `read` argument always gets an immutable reference or a local copy.
  You can't transfer a value into a `read` argument.

* The `owned` argument always gets a uniquely owned value, which may have been
  copied or transferred from the callee. Using `owned` arguments without the
  transfer sigil (`^`) usually results in values being copied.
