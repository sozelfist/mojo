# Welcome to Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is designed
to become the best way to extend Python over time.

This repo includes source code for:

- Mojo examples
- Mojo documentation hosted at [modular.com](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)
- The [Mojo standard library](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/lib)

This repo has two primary branches:

- The [`main`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/main) branch, which is in
sync with the last stable released version of Mojo. Use the examples here if youâ€™re
using a [release build of Mojo](#latest-released).

- The [`nightly`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/nightly) branch, which
is in sync with the Mojo nightly build and subject to breakage. Use this branch
for [contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md), or if you're using the latest
[nightly build of Mojo](#latest-nightly).

To learn more about Mojo, see the
[Mojo Manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/).

## Installing Mojo

### Latest Released

To install the last released build of Mojo, follow the guide to
[Get started with Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started).

### Latest Nightly

The nightly Mojo builds are subject to breakage and provide an inside
view of how the development of Mojo is progressing.  Use at your own risk
and be patient!

To get nightly builds, see the same instructions to [Get started with
Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started), but when you create
your project, instead use the following `magic init` command to set the
conda package channel to `max-nightly`:

```bash
magic init hello-world-nightly --format mojoproject \
  -c conda-forge -c https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly
```

Or, if you're [using conda](https://docs.modular.com/magic/conda), add the
`https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly/` channel to your `environment.yaml`
file. For example:

```yaml
[project]
name = "Mojo nightly example"
channels = ["conda-forge", "https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly/"]
platforms = ["osx-arm64", "linux-aarch64", "linux-64"]

[dependencies]
max = "*"
```

And when you clone this repo, switch to the `nightly` branch because the `main`
branch might not be compatible with nightly builds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modularml/mojo.git
```

```bash
git checkout nightly
```
