# Mojo code examples

A collection of sample programs and Mojo notebooks written in the
[Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/programming-manual.html) programming language.

## Getting Started

Access a Mojo programming environment available from the
Mojo product [page](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

Git clone the repository of Mojo samples using the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modularml/mojo.git
```

## Running

If you're using [`magic`](https://docs.modular.com/magic), navigate into
the examples directory and use `magic run`. For example:

```bash
magic run mojo matmul.mojo
```

You can run the Mojo notebooks using [JupyterLab or Visual Studio
Code](notebooks/README.md) with the Mojo extension available on the Marketplace.
