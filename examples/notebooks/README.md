# Mojo Jupyter notebooks

Mojo supports programming in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), just
like Python.

This page explains how to get started with Mojo notebooks, and this repo
directory contains notebooks that demonstrate some of Mojo's features.

If you're not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, they're files that allow you to
create documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory
text. They're basically documents with executable code blocks, making them
great for sharing code experiments and programming tutorials. We actually wrote
the [Mojo programming
manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/programming-manual.html) as a Jupyter
notebook, so we can easily test all the code samples.

And because Mojo allows you to import Python modules, you can use visualization
libraries in your notebooks to draw graphs and charts, or display images. For
an example, check out the `Mandelbrot.ipynb` notebook, which uses `matplotlib`
to draw the Mandelbrot set calculated in Mojo, and the `RayTracing.ipynb`
notebook, which draws images using `numpy`.

## Get started in VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a great environment for programming with Jupyter
notebooks. Especially if you're developing with Mojo on a remote system, using
VS Code is ideal because it allows you to edit and interact with notebooks on
the remote machine where you've installed Mojo.

All you need is Mojo and the Jupyter VS Code extension:

1. [Create a new Mojo
project](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started#1-create-a-new-project).

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the
   [Jupyter
   extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

3. Then open any `.ipynb` file with Mojo code, click **Select Kernel** in the
   top-right corner of the document, and then select **Jupyter Kernel > Mojo**.

   The Mojo kernel should have been installed automatically when you installed
   the Mojo SDK. If the Mojo kernel is not listed, make sure that your
   `$MODULAR_HOME` environment variable is set on the system where you
   installed the Mojo SDK (specified in the `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` file).

   Now run some Mojo code!

## Get started with JupyterLab

You can also select the Mojo kernel when running notebooks in a local instance
of JupyterLab. The following is just a quick setup guide for Linux users with
the Mojo SDK installed locally, and it might not work with your system (these
instructions don't support remote access to the JupyterLab). For more details
about using JupyterLab, see the complete [JupyterLab installation
guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).

### 1. Launch JupyterLab

You can use either Magic or conda.

#### Using Magic

If you have [`magic`](https://docs.modular.com/magic) you can run the following
command to launch JupyterLab from this directory:

```sh
# Run from an active conda or magic shell environment
magic run jupyter lab
```

After a moment, it will open a browser window with JupterLab running.

#### Using conda

Conda allows you to export environments in `.yml` format. (For more
information, see
[Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
in the Conda documentation.)

If you already have a working Jupyter environment on a different computer and
server you can export it using the following command.

```sh
# Example of exporting environment.yml from a conda environment named `your-env`
conda env export --name your_env > environment.yml
```

To create a Conda environment, activate that environment, and install JupyterLab.

``` sh
# Create a Conda environment if you don't have one
conda create -n mojo-repo
# Activate the environment
conda env update -n mojo-repo -f environment.yml --prune
# run JupyterLab
conda run -n mojo-repo jupyter lab
```

After a moment, it will open a browser window with JupterLab running.

#### Using more magic

Magic allows you to create an environment from a Conda `environment.yml`.

```sh
# Create a magic environment if you don't have one
magic init mojo-repo --import environment.yml
# Activate the environment
cd mojo-repo && magic shell
# run JupyterLab
magic run jupyter lab
```

### 2. Run the .ipynb notebooks

The left nav bar should show all the notebooks in this directory.
Open any `.ipynb` file and start running the code.

## Notes and tips

- Code in a Jupyter notebook cell behaves like code in a Mojo REPL environment:
  The `main()` function is not required, but there are some caveats:

  - Top-level variables (variables declared outside a function) are not visible
    inside functions.

  - Redefining undeclared variables is not supported (variables without a `let`
    or `var` in front). If youâ€™d like to redefine a variable across notebook
    cells, you must declare the variable with either `let` or `var`.

- You can use `%%python` at the top of a code cell and write normal Python
  code. Variables, functions, and imports defined in a Python cell are available
  from subsequent Mojo code cells.
