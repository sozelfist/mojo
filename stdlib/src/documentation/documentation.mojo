fn doc_private():
    """Indicate that the decorated declaration is private from the viewpoint
    of documentation generation.

    This decorator allows for hiding the documentation for a declaration during
    generation. This is often used to hide `__init__`, and other special
    methods, that are not intended to be part of a library's documentation.

    For example:

    ```mojo
    struct Foo:
        @doc_private
        fn __init__(out self):
            "This should not be called directly, use `Foo.create` instead."
            return

        @staticmethod
        fn create() -> Self:
            return Self()
    ```
    """
    return
