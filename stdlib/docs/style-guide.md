# Coding standards & style guide

This document describes conventions that Mojo standard library code should
adhere to. Its coverage ranges from non-semantic conventions like code
formatting, to semantics like value lifecycle behavior that standard library
types should generally conform to.

## Structure and formatting

### Files & layout

#### File structure

The Mojo standard library uses the following high-level organization:

- Group related functions within the same file.
- Group related files within the same directory.
- Do not add dependencies to the `stdlib` module because, by definition, it is
required to be a leaf dependency.

```text
> stdlib               # stdlib root directory
    > doc              # folder containing markdown documentation
    > scripts          # scripts for compiling and running the tests
    > src              # stdlib mojo source files
        > builtin      # mojo source for stdlib builtins
        > collections  # mojo source for stdlib collections
        > memory       # mojo source for stdlib memory primitives
        ...
    > test             # stdlib unit tests
```

All Mojo source files must end with the extension `.mojo` or `.üî•`.

#### Mojo format

Mojo provides a command line formatting utility, `mojo format`, designed to
automatically format your code according to the official Mojo style guidelines.
It adjusts indentation, spacing, and line breaks, making code more readable and
consistent.

```bash
> mojo format example.mojo
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file left unchanged.
```

Unless otherwise noted, Mojo standard library code should follow the formatting
produced by `mojo format`.

It is advised, to avoid forgetting, to set-up `pre-commit`, which will format
your changes automatically at each commit, and will also ensure that you
always have the latest linting tools applied.

To do so, install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

and that's it!

#### API Doc String Validation

Mojo provides a command line utility, `mojo doc`, to validate the API doc
strings in your code. This ensures that your doc strings are correctly
formatted and consistent with the Mojo style guidelines.
Note that you should not have any warnings.

```bash
> mojo doc --diagnose-missing-doc-strings --validate-doc-strings -o /dev/null stdlib/src/
```

Note that this is also included in the pre-commit. So if you have `pre-commit`
enabled, this will run automatically before committing. If you want to run it
manually with pre-commit, just run

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Whitespace

- Use vertical whitespace only as needed to organize code into logical sections.

#### File license header

Every file in the open source Mojo standard library should begin with the
following license information header:

```mojo
# ===----------------------------------------------------------------------=== #
# Copyright (c) 2024, Modular Inc. All rights reserved.
#

# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
# limitations under the License.
# ===----------------------------------------------------------------------=== #
```

#### Code header comments

Code in the Mojo standard library should use the following conventional
structure of header comments separating the various kinds of methods that can be
defined on structs.

```mojo
# ===-----------------------------------------------------------------------===#
# MyStruct
# ===-----------------------------------------------------------------------===#


struct MyStruct(Sized, Stringable):
    """Description goes here."""

    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#
    # Aliases
    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#

    alias factor = 5

    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#
    # Fields
    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#

    var field: Int

    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#
    # Life cycle methods
    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#

    fn __init__(...)
    fn __moveinit__(...)
    fn __copyinit__(...)

    fn __del__(...)

    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#
    # Factory methods
    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#

    @staticmethod
    fn foo(...) -> Self[...]

    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#
    # Operator dunders
    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#

    # Anything that "backs" special syntax: [..], *, +, /, //, etc...

    fn __getitem__
    fn __setitem__

    fn __getattr__
    fn __setattr__

    fn __iter__     # `for x in self`
    fn __next__
    fn __contains__ # `x in self`
    fn __is__       # `x is self`

    fn __add__
    fn __iadd__

    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#
    # Trait implementations
    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#

    fn __bool__
    fn __len__
    fn __str__

    fn __abs__

    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#
    # Methods
    # ===-------------------------------------------------------------------===#

    fn unsafe_ptr(..)   # e.g.
```

## Code conventions

### Python Standard Library

We want to be a good member of the Python family and aim to become a full
superset, so we inherit naming from the Python standard library, including any
inconsistencies. These naming inconsistencies are the only exceptions to the
naming conventions outlined below.

### Identifier naming conventions

There are several ways to capitalize and separate words, known as "case
styles." By following the same set of case styles in our code, Mojo developers
ensure their code is accessible and understandable to others in the community.

This first table is just a definition of the various "case styles."

| Case style             | Description                               | Example
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------
| `snake_case`           | All lowercase with underscores            | `variable_name`
| `PascalCase`           | Each word starts with an uppercase letter | `StructName`
| `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | All uppercase with underscores            | `CONSTANT_VALUE`
| `kebab-case`           | All lowercase with hyphens                | `project-name`
| `flatcase`             | All lowercase without separators          | `basename`

The following table shows our preferred use of different case styles.

| Code kind            | Example                        | Case style
|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------
| `fn` / `def`         | `fn engage_hyperdrive()`       | `snake_case`
| `struct`               | `struct Point`               | `PascalCase`
| `trait`                | `trait Copyable`             | `PascalCase`
| `enum`                 | `enum StatusCode`            | `PascalCase`
| `var`                  | `var the_value = 5`          | `snake_case`
| `module` / `package` | `io.mojo` / `os/__init__.mojo` | `flatcase` / `snake_case`
| dunder               | `__copyinit__`                 | `flatcase`
| decorator            | `@register_passable`           | `snake_case`
| **Parameters ‚Äî type or value**           |  &nbsp;    | &nbsp;
| `alias` type             | `alias Int8 = Scalar[DType.int8]`                      | `PascalCase`
| `alias` value global / local scope | `alias CHUNK_SIZE = 32` / `alias chunk_size = 32` | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` / `snake_case`
| `struct` type parameter  | `struct List[ElementType: Movable]`                    | `PascalCase`
| `struct` value parameter | `struct Array[ElementType: Movable, length: Int]`      | `snake_case`
| `fn` type parameter      | `fn do_it[Action: Actionable](action: Action)`         | `PascalCase`
| `fn` value parameter     | `fn repeat[count: Int]()`                              | `snake_case`

Although these are our style conventions, not all code currently adheres to it.
When preparing a new change, it is important to adhere to the style and naming
conventions already established in that module. Therefore, if the module you
are working on uses a different style, continue using that style to maintain
consistency. We are not currently accepting pull requests that propose
extensive formatting or renaming changes.

### Naming guidelines

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è¬†Prefer descriptive parameter names over single-letter names

```mojo
struct LinkedList[T: Movable]           # üî¥ Avoid
struct LinkedList[ElementType: Movable] # üü¢ Preferred
```

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è¬†Order type parameters ahead of value parameters

```mojo
struct Array[length: Int, ElementType: Movable] # üî¥ Avoid
struct Array[ElementType: Movable, length: Int] # üü¢ Preferred
```

### Container lifecycle semantics

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è¬†Prefer explicit copy constructors; avoid allowing implicit copies

```mojo
var copy = original            # üî¥ Avoid
var copy = MyStruct(original)  # üü¢ Preferred
```

Where you intend to make a copy, favor an explicit copy constructor to make your
intention clear.

Copying `@register_passable` types like `Int`, `Bool`, `Pointer`, and `SIMD` is
safe and inexpensive. However, copying types that dynamically allocate memory
can be expensive. This includes common types like `List`, `Dict`, `Set`,
`Tensor`, and `String`.

Some standard library types allow implicit copies where they shouldn‚Äôt. We will
resolve this shortly as new Mojo language features are shipped to help with this
very situation.

When designing a new type, don‚Äôt allow implicit copies unless
the copy is trivial (order `O(1)`). In other words, don‚Äôt define a
`__copyinit__()` function if the copy is expensive. Instead, define an
*explicit* copy constructor: an `__init__()` constructor that takes a value of
the same type:

```mojo
struct MyStruct:
    # Invoked as `MyStruct(other)`
    fn __init__(out self, other: Self):
        # do a deep copy of MyStruct
```

### Import statements

- Explicitly import entities used (functions, structs, aliases), rather
  than rely on transitive imports.
- Import only what you use; in general, avoid using
  `from some_package import *`.
- Import statements should be sorted lexicographically.

### API docstrings

Every public function and public struct (including data fields) in the standard
library must have docstrings (code comments that describe the API behavior).
Mojo includes tooling to ensure that public functions include docstrings.

You can run `./stdlib/scripts/check-docstrings.py` to validate
docstrings. If the command exits with a `0` exit code, the docstrings are
compliant; otherwise, an error will be shown. This is also enforced by the LSP
with warnings for anything that doesn‚Äôt conform, you can generate docstrings
based on the signature using an LSP Quick Fix:

<img src="./images/doc-lint-quick-fix.png" width=350 />

We follow Google's Python convention for
[docstrings outlined here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods)
which looks like this:

```mojo
fn add_param_arg[foo: Int](bar: Int) -> Int:
    """[summary].

    Parameters:
        foo: [description].

    Args:
        bar: [description].

    Returns:
        [description].
    """
    return foo + bar
```

The additions to the Google style guide for docstrings are `Parameters:` and
`Constraints:`.

`Constraints:` should be used to document requirements when using the
`constrained` builtin function:

```mojo
fn add_param_arg[foo: Int](bar: Int) -> Int:
    """Shortened doc string.

    Constraints:
        `foo` must be more than 0.
    """
    constrained[foo > 0]()
    return foo + bar
```

For more detailed style guidelines, see the
[Mojo docstring style guide](docstring-style-guide.md).

### Assertions

You should use assertions liberally when there is a condition you expect for the
following code to behave correctly. Assertions may be present even in
"unsafe" methods and types. You should format the message to be descriptive with
the expected and actual values:

```mojo
actual = 41
expected = 42
debug_assert(actual == expected, "expected: ", expected, " but got: ", actual)
```

Make sure that you don't allocate anything in the call to `debug_assert` to
ensure there is no runtime penalty when assertions are disabled. If you must
have a side-effect in the condition such as allocating a `String`, you can pass
a closure as a parameter that only runs when assertions are enabled:

```mojo
tensor = Tensor[DType.uint8, 1](TensorShape(1), cpu_device())

fn _test_cpu() capturing -> Bool:
    return "cpu" in str(tensor._device)

debug_assert[_test_cpu]("This code is only runnable on CPU")
```

### Testing

#### Unit test filenames

All test filenames should be prefixes with `test_`.
For example `test_sort.mojo`.
